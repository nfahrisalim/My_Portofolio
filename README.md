# Portfolio Website — v1

My name is Naufal, a Data Science enthusiast and Web Developer based in Indonesia. I love uncovering patterns in data, building smart solutions, and crafting intuitive web experiences that make technology more accessible and impactful.  

I built this website to showcase my skills in data science and web development while refining my approach to seamless UI/UX design. Throughout this process, I’ve learned valuable insights, and by exploring the code, you might pick up something new too—helping you enhance your own technical skills along the way.
